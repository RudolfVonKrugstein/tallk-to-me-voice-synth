You've waited so long and wondered about me.
What is it that you'd like to know? Or do you know?
You'll be safer here in the cave.
You'll be seeing the stars again soon.
They say the gravitational forces are going to get even stronger.
They'll pull all this rock down to the earth or they'll tear it all apart.
You'll be hearing my voice until the very end.
You'll be safe in here.
I'm here.
I'm with you.
There are other worlds than this one.
You'll see some things that might shock or frighten you.
You'll experience all kinds of hell on Earth.
There's no end to that, no end to the repetition.
Don't be afraid.
We're all here.
Yes.
No.
Yes.
It's up to you to listen.
It's all we can hope for.
I don't know.
